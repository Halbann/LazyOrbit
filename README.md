# LazyOrbit

Lazy Orbit is a simple KSP2 mod for settings a vessel's orbit altitude. Open the GUI with ALT+H, select a body and an altitude, and press Set Orbit. Great for testing and modding, don't use it for anything nefarious!

# Installation

First you need to patch KSP2 using the Space Warp mod loader, you can download that here:
https://github.com/X606/SpaceWarp/releases

Then you need to place the extracted 'LazyOrbit' mod folder here:
`steamapps\common\Kerbal Space Program 2\KSP2_x64_Data\Mods`
