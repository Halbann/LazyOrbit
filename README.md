# LazyOrbit v0.4.0

Lazy Orbit is a simple mod that allows you to set a vessel's orbit, land it on a surface, or teleport it to another vessel. Open the GUI by clicking the button in the APP.BAR (or press ALT+H), select a body and an altitude, and press Set Orbit. Great for testing and modding, don't use it for anything nefarious!
